{"data":{"airtable":{"data":{"title":"Big List of Resources","summary":"A huge list of resources for players and DMs alike.","author":"Eric","PostMarkdown":"# Big List of Resources\n\nHere's a list oflinks that I find inspiring when I create adventures and characters. It's super big yet, but I’m always adding stuff! For now, I’m keeping this list to things that I’ve used/watched/listened to and can personally recommend. \n\n[Shoot me an email](mailto:hello@gaininspiration.com) if you think I should add something and I’ll check it out.\n\n## Videos\n\n### For DMs  \n**[Matthew Colville’s Running the Game Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlUk42GiU2guNzWBzxn7hs8MaV7ELLCP)** \nA YouTube playlist that takes you through every aspect of, well, running the game of D&D. For new DMs and veterans alike. And players too for that matter.  \n\n**[MrRhexx’s Dungeons and Dragons Lore Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-Tj3kmYOOy2OVjoqTO8joausM-6JjcI-)**  \nA YouTube playlist that dives deep into the lore of Waterdeep and beyond. Way beyond. Great for all the little details like why gold dragons have whiskers.  \n\n**[Zee Bashew’s The Cold Road D&D Campaign Diary](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuNLwLRy7g-gKWlmo3mgr6U57lNU66Bga)**  \nSuper fun campaign setting and a great look behind the scenes at how a great DM adapts to character actions.  \n\n### For Players  \n**[Any video from Runesmith](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCweFJojRAFuxyYxe4KHL8vw/featured)**  \nFunny videos from a dude you just wanna be friends with. He doesn't go super in-depth, but he tells you what you need to know and he’ll make you laugh along the way.\n\n**[JoCat’s Crap Guide to D&D Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDnRMnDDjAzK5uZLidDUtHtD1iN06Qe0G)**  \nInsanely creative and fun videos that make for great beginner’s explanations. Keeps everything accessible and fun. Like D&D should be.\n\n**[Zee Bashew’s The Animated Spellbook](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuNLwLRy7g-gKWlmo3mgr6U57lNU66Bga)**  \nA gorgeously animated guide to spells and how to use them. And how not to use them. \n## Generators\n### Maps\n**[Watabou’s Medieval Fantasy City Generator](https://watabou.itch.io/medieval-fantasy-city-generator)**  \nA great little generator that provides a deceptively large amount of control. \n\n**[Watabou’s Toy Town](https://watabou.itch.io/toy-town)**  \nA tool that visualizes your medieval fantasy city into a 3D model you can walk around in!\n### Books\n**[Madeline Hale’s Table Fables](https://www.amazon.com/Table-Fables-collection-tables-master/dp/1542678595) and [Table Fables 2](https://www.amazon.com/Table-Fables-II-World-Builders-Handbook/dp/1983428000/ref=pd_sbs_14_img_0/132-6435579-3836508)**  \nThe first Table Fables is fantastic for in-game randomized fun. The second one is great for planning your next sesh.  \n## Podcasts\n**[Brian Posehn’s Nerd Poker (Old)](https://www.earwolf.com/show/nerd-poker/)**\nThis podcast got me into D&D. You need Stitcher Premium to listen now, but I think the first half is worth a listen if you haven’t heard it yet.\n\n**[Brian Posehn’s Nerd Poker (New)](https://nerdpokerpod.com/)**\nA revival of the classic and a ton of fun. Just a bunch of old friends playing D&D together.  \n\n**[GeeklyInc’s ~~Drunks & Dragons~~ Greetings Adventurers](https://geeklyinc.com/category/drunks-and-dragons/)**  \nThis is my all-time favorite D&D podcast. It took me from “Huh, D&D is kinda cool.” to “I have to play this right now.” Listen to them all if you can. If you can’t, they have some abridged episodes available. \n\n**[The McElroys The Adventure Zone](https://maximumfun.org/podcasts/adventure-zone/)**  \nI was late to the party on this one, but I made it! It’s a lot of fun and the McElroys come up with great in-game mechanics to keep things moving along.  \n\n**[Dungeons & Daddies](https://dungeonsanddaddies.com/)**  \nStop what you’re doing and listen to this podcast right now. You will thank me.\n\n**[Critical Role](https://critrole.com/)**  \nDon’t hate me, but I’ve never actually listened to Critical Role. But I would be remiss if I didn’t acknowledge its impact on D&D and nerd culture as a whole.  \n\n**[Imaginary Worlds](https://www.imaginaryworldspodcast.org/)**\nNot D&D focused, but a great look into geek culture, world building and what makes this all so engrossing.","date":null,"image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/6695f6a68968f40b3daf9b34f4a77c9e/ec7faa58/ian-gonzalez-oVXMtsMejqo-unsplash.jpg"}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"resources"}}
